				<h2><a href='https://github.com/invigoro/cs512-FinalProject'>Kart Racing Game</a></h2>
				<h3>Software Developer</h3>
				<p>This kart-racing game allows you to traverse a procedurally generated environment in order to collect
					orbs to try for a high score.</p>
				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p>Written in WebGL Javscript, this game can be played entirely in the browser. It did not make use of
					any existing game engine---instead, everything is code from the ground up.</p>
				<p>This kart game demonstrates implementations of a number of computer graphics fundamentals, such as
					defining primitives, hierarchical modeling, the Blinn-Phong lighting model, texture mapping, and
					bump mapping. Additionally, several types of physics simulation are present, including collision
					detection, kart movement, and particle generation.</p>
				<p>The levels are procedurally generated, with a randomization factor for the environment (trees,
					obstacles, orbs, road segments, clouds). At each completed level, the difficulty increases by adding
					in more orbs to collect and more obstacles to avoid.</p>

				<h2>Cluest - Mobile Game</h2>
				<h3>Lead Software Engineer/Project Manager/Game Designer</h3>
				<p>Cluest is a mobile gaming application built using React Native for simultaneous release to Android
					and iOS devices.</p>
				<h4>How It Works</h4>
				<p>As a mobile treasure hunting game, Cluest utilizes the device's built-in location service in order to
					send users on treasure hunts. When a user joins, Cluest automatically finds friends using Facebook's
					API. From there, a player can walk around anywhere and save their current location. This becomes a
					<i>clue</i> with some type of hint to help anyone find the location. Once a user has enough clues,
					they can string them together into a sequence called a <i>treasure hunt</i> and send it to their
					friends! Once a person has received a hunt from another user, they can enter <i>treasure hunt
						mode</i> to play the the hunt, where each clue found will point them towards the next one for a
					complete treasure hunt.</p>

				<h4>Building It</h4>
				<p>Initially, it was difficult for me to decide on which technologies and services to use in order to
					create this game. I considered Android Studio, Amazon Web Services, and Apache Server for various
					aspects of the program. Eventually, I decided on using React Native--even though the technology is
					fairly new--in order to have a simultaneous release to Android and iOS. Additionally, I went with
					Google Firebase as the back-end service for its easy of use, scalability, and integration with
					authentication techniques. Learning and becoming familiar with all of these new technologies over a
					couple of months was difficult, but well worth it in the end!</p>
				<h4>More Info</h4>
				</p>Want to see the source code? It's available <a href='https://github.com/invigoro/Cluest-Prototype'

				<!--<p>The complete app will be available soon for download on mobile devices. Check here for updates!</p> -->
